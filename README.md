# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
# Project Idea:
Our project aims to develop a sentiment analysis tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize text-based data into positive or negative sentiments. The tool will also identify and visualize emotions expressed within the text.
# How we will achieve this:
## 1. Classical Approach:
### Data Collection: 
We will store our text data in a text file, containing various sentences or paragraphs for analysis.
### Emotion Mapping:
We will create another file to map sets of words to corresponding emotions. This will serve as our dictionary for sentiment and emotion identification.
### Data Preprocessing: 
The text data will be pre-processed by tokenizing it, and converting the text into a format suitable for analysis. We may remove common stop words( “the”, “and”, “is”) to focus on meaningful meaning.
### Emotion analysis: 
We will analyze the input data for emotions, count their occurrences, and visualize the results using Matplotlib to provide a clear representation of the sentiments and emotions expressed.
### Sentiment Classification:
Using the NLTK library, we aim to determine whether the text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.
## 2. Machine Learning Approach:
### Model Training: 
We will train two machine learning models:
A sentiment analysis model to predict whether the text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.
An emotion analysis model to identify and classify emotions expressed in the text into six categories: Sadness, joy, Love, Anger, Fear, and Surpise.
### Datasets:
The sentiment analysis model will be trained using twitter datasets with the text labeled as positive or negative. 
The emotion  analysis model will be trained using datasets with text labeled with one of the six emotion categories.
## Expected Outcome:
A sentiment analysis tool capable of categorizing text-based data into positive or negative sentiments.
Visualization of emotions expressed within the text.
Accurate predictions from trained models for both sentiment and emotion analysis.
